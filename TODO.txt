   * Implement Command parser via gps commands (<? gps system.memory() ?> would return how much RAM does system have (2GB example))
      - this would work via atributes so there would be class system and method memory, which would return amount of ram)

      - EAXMPLE:  (Our system has <? gps system.memory() ?> of RAM and CPU is working with <? gps system.cpu(true) ?> per second
